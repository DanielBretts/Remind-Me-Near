## About

Introducing "RemindMeNear", your personal assistant that keeps you on track wherever you go. 
Never miss a task, appointment, or important errand again! RemindMeNear leverages the power of location technology to deliver timely reminders when you're near a specific location.
The app was made as a final project for "Mobile Security" course in my college.
