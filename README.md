## About

Introducing "RemindMeNear", your personal assistant that keeps you on track wherever you go. 
Never miss a task, appointment, or important errand again! RemindMeNear leverages the power of location technology to deliver timely reminders when you're near a specific location.
The app was made as a final project for "Mobile Security" course in my college.

## Technology

The app uses a combination of foreground service and fused location provider to provide accurate and efficient location tracking. By utilizing a foreground service, "RemindMeNear" ensures that location updates continue even when the app is running in the background or the device is in a doze mode, guaranteeing reliable and uninterrupted reminders.
